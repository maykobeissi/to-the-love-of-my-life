Like i meant me treating you like tomorrow is promised not the other way around, I realized that sometimes i treat you awfully, when im mad at you from time to time, and instead of staying calm and trying to talk it out like you do everytime i just get mad and treat you bad and talk to you in a way that you dont deserve to be talked to in (if that makes sense) and no matter how mad I am i shouldnt be doing any of that i dont want you to feel like you dont matter to me at some points in our relationship, i want you to know how much i truly appreciate you and everything you do, im sorry for making it look like i dont care about you sometimes, and for getting mad at you over the tiniest details, im just scared of losing you, you mean the world to me baby and I never wanna lose you, youâ€™re so precious to me, youâ€™re the guy that brought my smile and spark back, youâ€™re the guy that made my life a million times better, i cant imagine life without you, youâ€™re a part of my life i never want to lose nor give up on, which i can promise you that i wont, iâ€™ll never ever give up on you nor our relationship, youâ€™re all i ever wanted in a guy and everyday im reminded of how lucky i am to have a boyfriend like you by my side, thank you for being patient and taking your time with me, and thank you for caring about our relationship and not giving up on us even after everything weâ€™ve been together, you mean the world  to me and i just want you to know how much i value you and love you from the bottom of my heart, i love you so much w im sorry i didnt have enough time to write you something proper enough iâ€™ll fix it when im home i promise
