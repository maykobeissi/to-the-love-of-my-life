    <h1>To The Love of My Life 💌</h1>
    <p>hey baby I was trying to make you something earlier, on this link: 
      <a href="https://totheloveofmylife.lovepage.io/" target="_blank" style="color:#ffccd5">https://totheloveofmylife.lovepage.io/</a>, 
      but what happened is that it wouldnt let me read it off my phone without premium, so i figured i'd make my own website from scratch and customize it the way i want,
      I hope you like it, and finally here's the paragraph I've been writing, I know it's not much but i hope it makes your day when you read it baby, i love you:
    </p>
    <p><em style="color: #ffccd5">hey darling, i dont know when you'll be reading this, but i am definitely missing you as you read it and i cant stop thinking about you, you've been on my mind all day long ever since i woke up till now,  and i just find myself smiling like an idiot whenever i think about you and how much of an amazing boyfriend you are, you're really the best boyfriend to ever exist and words could never be enough for me to explain how lucky i feel to have you by my side, how happy i am to be able to call you mine, how thankful i am for everything you do to make me happy, you never fail to put a smile on my face even when im at my lowest, just receiving a notification from you lightens up my mood and im not even exaggerating, talking to you makes my day a million times better, and hearing your voice soothes me, whenever i feel overwhelmed just hearing your voice is more than enough for me to calm down a little, you truly dont understand how much you make my life better, just having you by my side makes everything easier, knowing i have someone to rely on, someone to care for and to love, someone to talk to, someone to be proud of, and knowing that this person is you makes me so happy, i dont know how many times i've said it till now but i really am so happy to have you baby, you mean the world to me and i never wanna lose you, i hope i dont, it would devastate me and absolutely shatter me to lose the love of my life, i can’t imagine my life without you in it, you’re a part of me i cant live without and cant afford to lose, you complete me, every time i think about you i feel like i fulfilled my dreams of having a perfect boyfriend, i know that I fulfilled them, you’re truly the best boyfriend anyone could ever ask for, you’re sweet and caring and incredibly thoughtful, and you’re good looking, i love everything about you from head to toe, and i cant think of a single flawed feature you have, not that you own any, everything about you is more than perfect, your hair for starters is the softest looking hair i’ve ever seen, and it looks so fun to play with, and then your eyes, the prettiest pair of eyes to ever exist, the dreamy eyes i get lost in, the eyes i want my kids to have, the eyes that look at me in a way no one else did, the gaze i fell in love with, your eyes are so pretty and i can definitely say they’re my favorite feature of yours after your smile, because that smile of yours has to be the most heartwarming smile i’ve ever seen in my entire life. Your smile is the cutest and most contagious smile to ever exist, i love it more than anything, and i dont see a reason for you to hate it baby your smile is adorable, i only wish to see you happy, to see the smile that makes my heart melt in a second, i really can’t explain how cute you look when you’re happy but you look absolutely adorable. And dont get me started with your lips, i wish i could kiss them every day, every night, all the time basically, i just wanna kiss you all over and cup your face with my handss and play with your hair all day long, while i tell you how much you mean to me, how much i love and appreciate you, and how i’d do everything i possibly can just to keep you happy, and to keep you by my side, i really would do anything for you, i would die for you, i love you so much habib you truly don’t understand how much im in love with you, i'm obsessed with you baby i adore you with all the love i have in my heart, i’ve never felt as loved and appreciated and cared for and seen and wanted and understood and safe and happy as i feel with you, and i hope i make you feel the same way baby i never want you to feel any less than that, i truly want what's best for you, and i promise you i'm really trying my hardest for our relationship to work out, i promise you i'm putting all my time and effort and attention and i'm doing everything i can to maintain our relationship, i promise you this isn't a waste of time baby we'll make it work no matter the circumstances, no matter the time, the distance, the difficulties, i'm ready to face it all if it means being with the love of my life, being with my baby, my boyfriend, my sweet boy, my other half, my world, my everything, i love you from the bottom of my heart baby and i can promise you it'll never change, my love for you keeps growing day by day, hour by hour, minute by minute, second by second, my love for you is endless baby, and it'll always be that way. I'll always love you, you'll always have a special place in my heart, just like you do now, you're a part of my heart if not already occupying it fully (you are), and no i'm not complaining. I'm now continuing this after we saw each other, and i just wanna say i adored every second of this day, firstly im sorry for not immediately hugging you although i really wanted to, i was just messing around, you looked so handsome from afar and even better when i got closer, and just seeing you smile was enough to make me forget about all my problems, your smile is absolutely captivating and im in love with it, im in love with you, im obsessed with you. I enjoyed every minute spent with you, from the arcade to starbucks to the photobooth to roadster, just being with you made my day a million times better baby. I'm sorry i was stressing out a little when we went alone but honestly that had to be the best moment of the entire day, for me at least, the way you were just so gentle and affectionate with me, it's like i fell in love with you all over again, the way you wrapped your arm around me, the way you were talking to me, the way you were looking at me with your pretty eyes, it felt unreal, it felt like it was just the two of us in this world, and i absolutely loved it baby, i wish i didnt stress as much, and i hope i'll get to see you one more time at least before you leave, i need to hug you and kiss you all over your face, and play with your hair while you lay on my lap, i really need to baby you, to show you how much i love you and care about you, you're so precious baby i really dont know what i possibly could've done throughout my entire existence to deserve you, but im so thankful to have you by my side, im so grateful to be able to talk to you on a daily basis, i promise you're the only guy i want, the only guy i need, the only guy i have eyes for, you're truly the best boyfriend ever, I could never ask for more, because i already have the best and most perfect boyfriend there is, i love you so much habib, more than words could ever describe, i really see a future with you, i see the most perfect and loving boyfriend and husband to ever exist, and i promise im willing to do whatever it takes for us to spend the rest of our lives together, i know we're still young but i truly believe you're the one for me, i believe i found the one i'm spending eternity with, i believe i found my soulmate, my other half, my missing piece, i believe we were meant to be and destined, i believe i found the purest and most precious guy known to mankind, and i strongly believe and know we can make our relationship last forever, we can make it work, i trust you profoundly and i know you wont let me down, neither will i, which is why im willing to take every risk and try my best for you, i'm never letting go of you, no matter what. I can keep going forever, I have so much to say, but you already went to sleep it's 1:30 am, and i wont keep you waiting darling. I love you so much baby, and i hope you know how much you mean to me, and how much you matter to me, you really are the best thing that has ever happened to me and i never want to lose you ever, i dont want you to be just another guy, you're already far away from that, and im glad you are, im glad we both took each other seriously, i feel like the happiest girl just by being able to call you my boyfriend, once again i love you so much baby, and im sorry if i ever hurt you or acted in a way that bothered you or if i ever did anything that made you doubt my love for you, i love you more than anything, more than anyone in this world, you and our relationship are my priorities, and you come first, before anyone and anything, I hope you know that. I love you so much baby, and I hope you're having the best sleep of your life ❤</em></p>
